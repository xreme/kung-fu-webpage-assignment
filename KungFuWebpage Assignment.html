<br>
Styles including<font color = Red> Shaolin </font>, <font color= yellow>Tai Chi </font> and <font color= green> Qigong </font> have many followers worldwide. Some westerners think that all Chinese people are Kung Fu masters. That 19s not true, but this traditional heritage has its unique existence in modern times and left much influence on the locals 19 lifestyle.
<br>
<br>
Although being fighting styles, Kung Fu advocates virtue and peace, not aggression or violence. This has been the common value upheld by martial artists from generation to generation. With a number of movement sets, boxing styles, weapon skills and some fighting stunts, Kung Fu keeps its original function of self-defense. Now its value in body-building and fitness is also highly appreciated.
